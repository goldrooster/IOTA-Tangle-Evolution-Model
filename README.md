# IOTA-Tangle-Evolution-Model

## Background
The code of the dPLN fitting process and visulation of fitting results. 

## Install
Python 3.8

## Usage
### Parameter generator
To get the set of parameters of dPLN, run the _runScripyEM.py_ and the output will be stored as .csv file in EM_para folder. The output includes all iterations of each tangle fitting process until the algorithm reach the termination condition. 

### Graphical fitting plot 
To check the graphical fitting plot, run the _draw_fitting_all_models.py_, we will see the graphical fitting result of the tangle. 

### Fitting process animation 
To check the fitting process of the dPLN fitting algorithm, run the _draw_fitting_ani.py_ and we will see optimitation process of parameters.
